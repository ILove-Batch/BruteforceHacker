Welcome to the SMB Brute-Force Tutorial

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for effectively using the brute-force password tool included in this package.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have a valid IP address and username for the target system.
Password List: The tool accepts any properly formatted text file (.txt) containing potential passwords.
Using the Tool:

Follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary information. The tool will systematically attempt to log in using each password from your list.
Keep an eye on the output for successful logins or any errors encountered during the process.
Specifying a Password List:

To use a password list, simply enter the filename with its extension (e.g., passwords.txt).
If the file is stored outside of this folder, specify the full path. For instance: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\LISTNAME.txt.
Creating a Custom Password List:

Create a .txt file in this directory, listing potential passwords line by line. Avoid empty lines to ensure accuracy.
This tutorial aims to help you navigate the tool efficiently and maximize the effectiveness of your brute-force operations.
